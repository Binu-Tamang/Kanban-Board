# React + TypeScript + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend updating the configuration to enable type aware lint rules:

- Configure the top-level `parserOptions` property like this:

```js
export default tseslint.config({
  languageOptions: {
    // other options...
    parserOptions: {
      project: ['./tsconfig.node.json', './tsconfig.app.json'],
      tsconfigRootDir: import.meta.dirname,
    },
  },
})
```

- Replace `tseslint.configs.recommended` to `tseslint.configs.recommendedTypeChecked` or `tseslint.configs.strictTypeChecked`
- Optionally add `...tseslint.configs.stylisticTypeChecked`
- Install [eslint-plugin-react](https://github.com/Binu-Tamang/Kanban-Board.git) and update the config:

```js
// eslint.config.js
import react from 'eslint-plugin-react'

export default tseslint.config({
  // Set the react version
  settings: { react: { version: '18.3' } },
  plugins: {
    // Add the react plugin
    react,
  },
  rules: {
    // other rules...
    // Enable its recommended rules
    ...react.configs.recommended.rules,
    ...react.configs['jsx-runtime'].rules,
  },
})
```
Here’s a detailed README template for your Kanban Board with drag-and-drop functionality:

---

# Kanban Board with Drag-and-Drop

This is a Kanban Board application that supports drag-and-drop functionality, designed to visually organize and manage tasks effectively.

---

## Features

- Drag-and-Drop Support: Intuitive task movement between columns.
- Customizable Columns: Add, edit, or remove columns to match your workflow.
- Task Management: Create, update, and delete tasks seamlessly.

4. [Future Improvements](#future-improvements)

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v16 or above) installed on your machine.
- A code editor like VS Code.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/kanban-board.git
   cd kanban-board
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

4. Open the application:
   Visit `http://localhost:3000` in your browser.

## Technology Choices and Rationale

1. React.js  
   - Why: React's component-based architecture allows modular and reusable code, making it ideal for building dynamic UIs like a Kanban board.  
   
2. React-DnD or React-Beautiful-DnD  
   - Why: These libraries simplify drag-and-drop functionality, ensuring smooth interactions.  

3. CSS Modules or Tailwind CSS  
   - Why: Tailwind provides utility-first styling, reducing custom CSS overhead, while CSS modules ensure scoped styling.  

4. LocalStorage or Mock API  
   - Why: To persist tasks temporarily during development without needing a backend setup.

5. TypeScript (optional)  
   - Why: Ensures type safety and helps catch errors early, making the codebase robust and maintainable.

---

## Known Limitations/Trade-offs

1. Persistence  
   - Currently uses `LocalStorage` for task persistence. A database integration would be more robust for multi-user scenarios.  

2. Performance  
   - Handling a large number of tasks or columns may affect drag-and-drop performance. Optimizations may be needed.  

3. Accessibility  
   - Limited support for keyboard navigation or screen readers. Enhancements are required to ensure inclusivity.

4. Responsive Design  
   - While the layout is mobile-friendly, some interactions (e.g., drag-and-drop) are less intuitive on smaller screens.

---

## Future Improvements

1. Backend Integration  
   - Add a backend service (e.g., Node.js with MongoDB or Firebase) for real-time data synchronization and multi-user support.

2. Improved Accessibility  
   - Enhance support for ARIA roles and keyboard navigation to meet accessibility standards.

3. Advanced Features  
   - Task prioritization with labels or tags.  
   - User collaboration (e.g., assign tasks, comments, notifications).  
   - Search and filter options.

4. Optimized Drag-and-Drop  
   - Use advanced libraries or algorithms to improve drag-and-drop performance on large datasets.

5. Mobile Optimization  
   - Refine drag-and-drop interactions for touch devices.
